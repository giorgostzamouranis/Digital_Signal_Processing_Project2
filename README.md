# Digital_Signal_Processing_Python_Project2
The project focuses on psychoacoustic signal encoding. In the first part, we analyze a windowed music signal and apply various functions and processes using a psychoacoustic model. In the second part, we implement a series of bandpass filters, known as a filterbank (including both analysis and synthesis filters), and apply quantization using two different methods.

This project was developed as part of the "Digital Signal Processing" course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA. The purpose of this work is not to present it as personal research but rather as my approach to the assigned tasks. For a detailed description of the project tasks, please refer to the project prompt (provided in Greek).

Special thanks to my fellow student, Nikolaos Katsaidonis (https://github.com/NikosK10), for collaborating with me on the implementation of this project.
